# Program 1
## Aim
To write an assembly language program to count Hex numbers Up
## Algorithm
1. Accumulator is loaded with 00 and incremented till FF.
2. A delay is called in between

# Program 2
## Aim
To write an assembly language program to count Hex numbers Down
## Algorithm
1. Accumulator is loaded with FF and decremented till 00.
2. A delay is called in between

# Program 3
## Aim

## Algorithm
1. Accumulator is loaded with 00 and incremented till 99.
2. A delay is called in between

# Program 4
## Aim
To write an assembly language program to BCD numbers Down
## Algorithm
1. Accumulator is loaded with 99 and decremented till 00.
2. A delay is called in between
