# Program 1
## Aim
To write a program to blink the builtin LED of ESP826 using Arduino IDE.
## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Set the pin mode of the builtin LED(GPIO2) as OUTPUT.
3. Turn the LED ON by setting the pin LOW.
4. Wait for 1 second.
5. Turn the LED OFF by setting the pin HIGH.
6. Wait for 1 second.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

# Program 2
## Aim
To write a program to blink an external LED connected to ESP8266 using Arduino IDE.
## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Set the pin mode of GPIO5 as output
3. Turn the LED ON by setting the pin LOW.
4. Wait for 1 second.
5. Turn the LED OFF by setting the pin HIGH.
6. Wait for 1 second.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
