# Program 1
## Aim
To write a program to add two 8 bit numbers

## Algorithm
1. The two 8 bit numbers are stored in external memory
2. Add the two numbers and store the result in a memory location
3. If there is a carry, store the carry in a memory location

# Program 2
## Aim
To write a program to familiarize all arithmetic operations

## Algorithm
1. The two 8 bit numbers are stored in external memory
2. Add the two numbers and store the result in a memory location
3. Subtract the two numbers and store the result in a memory location
4. Multiply the two numbers and store the result in two consecutive memory locations
5. Divide the two numbers and store the quotient and remainder in two consecutive memory locations
6. Increment a number and store the result in a memory location
7. Decrement a number and store the result in a memory location

# Program 3
## Aim
To write a proram to subtract two 8 bit numbers

## Algorithm
1. The two 8 bit numbers are stored in external memory
2. Subtract the two numbers and store the result in a memory location

# Program 4
## Aim
To write a program to multiply two 8 bit numbers

## Algorithm
1. The two 8 bit numbers are stored in external memory
2. Take the first number and store it in B
3. Take the second number and store it in A
4. The two numbers are then multiplied. Multiplication of two 8 bit numbers results in a 16 bit number. The lower and higher bytes of the multiplication operations are moved to the external memory. The higher bytes of the result after the multiplication operation will be in B and the lower bytes will be in A
5. The result is stored in external memory

# Program 5
## Aim
To write a program to divide two 8 bit numbers

## Algorithm
1. The dividend and divisor are stored in external memory
2. The dividend is stored in A and the divisor is stored in B
3. Division operation is carried out which divides the number in A by the number in B
4. The quotient is stored in A and the remainder is stored in B, which is to be stored in external memory
