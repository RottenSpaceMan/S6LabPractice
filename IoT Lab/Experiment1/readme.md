# Program 1
## Aim
To write a program to move a block of memory from one location another

## Algorithm
1. Set byte counter
2. Get the number from the source and copy it to the destination
3. Decrement the byte counter and repeat step 2 until the byte counter is reset

## Procedure
1. Enter the program in memory locations starting from 4100H
2. Enter 5 numbers in memory location starting from 4500H
3. Execute the program and verify the result in memory location starting from 4600H

# Program 2
## Aim
To write a program to exchange block of data between two memories

## Algorithm
1. Set byte counter
2. Get the number from both locations
3. Exchange the numbers between the two locations
4. Decrement the byte counter and repeat step 2 until the byte counter is reset

## Procedure
1. Enter the program in memory locations starting from 4100H
2. Enter 5 numbers in memory location starting from 4500H
3. Enter 5 numbers in memory location starting from 4600H
